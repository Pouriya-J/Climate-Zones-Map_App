# Climate-Zones-Map_App

The National Energy Code of Canada for Buildings (NECB) has divided Canada into six “Climate Zones” – named 4, 5, 6, 7a, 7b, and 8. These Climate Zones are based on the accumulation of Heating Degree Days (HDDs). 

Due to the changing climate, these existing Climate Zones no longer accurately represent the climatic reality that buildings experience now, nor throughout their designed lifespan. 

This app will allow you to use climate model projections to compute future Climate Zones. You can select different emission scenarios and ensemble percentiles to find your location's climate zone and HDDs in the future.
